        The Modes Panel has five different modes. To select the mode you want to work in, simply click on one of the five icons at the top of the Modes Panel, or hold down the Shift key and press either the 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 key depending on which mode you want to select.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        The first mode is called Place Mode. Place Mode can be selected by pressing Shift+1 or by clicking on the first icon, the one with the brown box and light bulb.
        <br>
        <br>
        Place Mode is used to place Actors into your Level. The Content Browser is also used for placing Actors but there are a few key differences. Place Mode is used for simple, common, generic Actors, while the Actors in the Content Browser tend to be more complex. Also, the list of Actors in Place Mode remains static. You cannot add new Actors to the Place Mode panel, while in the Content Browser, you can import content created outside of the Unreal Editor into your project or create new ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        To use Place Mode to place an Actor into a Level, simply click on the Actor and drag it into the Viewport. To delete an Actor from the Level, press the Delete key when that Actor is selected.
        <br>
        <br>
        Place Mode is divided into tabs of different groupings of Actors. Starting with the Basic tab, the Basic tab simply contains 10 of the most commonly used Actors.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Above the Basic tab is the Recently Placed tab. This will be a list of Actors that you have recently placed into your Level. This is useful when you are going to be working with
        
a small set of the same types of Actors for a while. In that scenario you would be able to just keep the Recently Placed tab open, and drag and drop everything from there, without having to switch between all of the other tabs.
Below the Basic tab is the Lights tab. As mentioned earlier in the book, a Light in the Unreal Engine is an Actor that is meant to represent the light projecting from some source.
Then we have Visual Effects, which as its name suggests, contains Actors that add a variety of effects to your Level.
<br>
        <br>
The BSP tab contains the Geometry Brushes that were briefly introduced earlier. BSP stands for “Binary Space Partitioning” but that’s not important to know. Just know that this is the Brushes tab.
The Volumes tab is used to define gameplay volumes. A Volume is a 3D area of space that is invisible to the player and serves a specific purpose depending on its type. For example, a Blocking Volume will prevent Actors from being able to enter that Volume, a Pain Causing Volume will cause damage to an Actor who enters that volume, and so on.
Last, is the All Classes tab, which contains all the Actors from the other tabs, plus some additional Actors not found in any of the other tabs, either because they are less common or just didn’t fit nicely into one of the other

groups.

        <br> The list is somewhat long, so you may want to use the search bar above. By typing into the search bar, you can quickly narrow down the results to what you are looking for.
