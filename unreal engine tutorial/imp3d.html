Importing 3D Objects From Internet

        This section will show you a couple more places where you can find free 3D objects to download, and how to import those objects into Unreal Engine.

One great website to get free 3D models from is tf3dm.com. You can use the search box to look for something specific, or you can browse the categories using the icons. Under the description of the category will be a row of subcategories you can browse to.

One of the great things about this site is that it is specifically devoted to free 3D objects. There is a strip at the top advertising 3D models for a price, but other than that, all the results that appear will be free to download. However, something you need to be aware of that is very important if you’re planning on making games that you charge money for, is that just because an Asset is free to download, that doesn’t necessarily mean you are free to use it in a commercial game (a game that makes money).
<br>
<br>
For example, some Assets come with a Personal Use Only license. This means you’re allowed to download it, and import it in your projects, and make a game with it; but the only thing you can do with that game is play it yourself or perhaps give it away for free to a few friends. If you started charging money for the game, the person who created the Asset would be allowed to sue you for violating the terms of the license.
<br>
<br>
So if you want to find objects that are free to use in commercial games, you can check the checkbox under the search bar labeled “Commercial license only” and then run the search again. This will filter the results down to only those with Commercial Use licenses. However, you still need to see if the Asset comes with any further stipulations. Often, the artist will require you to credit them in the work in order for the license to be valid.
