Importing And Converting Audio

        Most of the time, importing audio files into Unreal Engine will be as straightforward as importing any other type of file. You can either click the Import button in the Content Browser and browse to the file you want to import, or you can simply drag and drop the file directly into the Content Browser.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the file is a wave file, formatted the way Unreal Engine likes it, the file will be converted to a Sound Wave Asset which you can then use as you like. For Unreal Engine to successfully import an audio file, it must be an uncompressed, 16-bit wave file. But if you try to import an audio file that isn’t in the right format, such as an MP3, or an 8-bit wave, you will get an error message.
        <br>

       <br>
        To get the file into the proper format so that the Engine can import it, you simply need to open the file in an application that can read it, and then export it back out in the proper format. One program that can do this is Audacity. It is free to download and use, can read many different types of audio files in various formats, and it can export those files in a format which the Unreal Engine can read.
        <br>
        <br>
The easiest way to find a copy of Audacity to download is to simply go to your favorite search engine and type “download Audacity” and click on the first result. Or you can just type in the following address directly - audacityteam.org/download. From there, click on the link that corresponds to your operating system, click on the “installer” link, and then run the .exe file that is downloaded.
<br>
<br>
If you are running Windows 10, this will probably still work. However, if you get an error message when trying to open a file in Audacity, go back to the first page and click on the link in the line “Windows 10 may require appropriate audio drivers” and then follow the instructions from there.
<br>
<br>
Once you have Audacity installed, converting your audio files into the proper formatting is pretty simple. First, go to
<br>
<br>
File > Open, and open the file you want converted. If you get a Warning message, simply leave the default choice selected and click “OK.” Now, go back up to the File menu and click on “Export Audio.” Give the new file a name and make sure the type selected is “WAVE signed 16 bit PCM” which should be the default choice. Now click on “Save,” and when the Edit Metadata box pops up, you can simply press OK without making any changes.

<br>
<br>
The file should now be properly formatted, and when you drag-and-drop it into the Content Browser, it should import it into the project without any problems.
