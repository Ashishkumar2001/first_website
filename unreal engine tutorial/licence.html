      In this tutorial you will be learning how to use what many consider to be the best game engine in the industry. The Unreal Engine has been used to create several blockbuster games and game franchises, including BioShock, Gears of Wars, Splinter Cell, Rainbow 6, Borderlands, Dishonored, Mass Effect, and many more.
The biggest disadvantage of the Unreal Engine was that, for most of its existence, it was too expensive for anyone but large companies and wealthy individuals.
<br>
<br>
Epic Games, the creators of the Unreal Engine, realized that because of this, there were huge numbers of budding game developers starting their game development lives getting used to competing engines. These other engines were being offered for free, in exchange for a percentage of any profits made from the games.
Due to this increasing competition, Epic Games decided to adopt a similar business model. In March 2015, the Unreal Engine became completely free to download and use. The only stipulation is that if you create something on it that makes more than $3000 in a single quarter (meaning a quarter of a year), then you have to pay a 5% royalty to Epic Games for any sales above the $3000.
Now, for the first time ever, the Unreal Engine is accessible
to amateurs, hobbyists and indie developers, and not just the major game studios of the world.
