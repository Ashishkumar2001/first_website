       <b class="subheading"> Learn Tab</b>
       <br>
       <br>
        If you go to the Learn tab and scroll down, starting with the Engine Feature Samples category, you will find a lot of content you can use in your games and also sample
projects that help to illustrate various concepts and features of the Engine.
<br>
<br>
For example, the Open World Demo Collection contains various meshes like grass, rocks, bushes and trees that you can use to make nice-looking outdoor terrains. There are downloads for water, mountains, particle effects, Blueprints, and so on. Thereâ€™s also projects you can download that demonstrate certain gameplay concepts or even entire sample games. You can click on any of the boxes to get more details and to actually download the content.
<br>
<br>
<b class="subheading"> Marketplace Tab</b>
<br>
<br>
The Epic Games Marketplace is where you can find Assets to purchase. You can get to the Marketplace either by clicking on the Marketplace tab in the Epic Games Launcher, or by clicking on the Marketplace button in the Toolbar of the Level Editor.
<br>
<br>
The Marketplace is divided into various categories based on the Assets provided. For example, you have environments, materials, audio, and so on. You can get to the various categories either by scrolling through the page, or by using the links in the menu to go straight to the category. Same as the Learn tab, just click on the boxes to learn more about that content or to download it.
<br>
<br>
<b class="subheading"> Vault</b>
<br>
<br>
 When you download something through the Learn tab or the Marketplace, you can access it by clicking on the Library tab and going down to the Vault section. If the content is a sample project, you can click on the yellow button under its name to create that project. If the content is a group of Assets, you can click on the yellow button to add those folders to the Content Browser of an existing project that you specify.
