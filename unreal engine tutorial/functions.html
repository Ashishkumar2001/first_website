       Functions

        A function is a procedure or routine meant to carry out a specific task or series of tasks. Functions are not unique to Unreal Engine. A function is a concept that comes from mathematics and computer science. In computer science and programming, a function is a specific block of code. By extension, in Unreal Engine, a function is a specific Event Graph of Nodes. The entire Event Graph for a function gets encapsulated (contained) within a single Node that can then be used without having to worry about the details inside it.
<br>
<br>
        To create a new function, go to the My Blueprint tab, look for the Functions category, and then click on the Add button. Whenever you create a new function, it will automatically open that function’s Event Graph and add its Entry Node. The Entry Node is the Node that will fire whenever the function is called.

      <b class="subheading">  Advantages of Using Functions</b>
      <br>
        <br>
      Using functions has many advantages. The main advantage is reusability. For example, if you wanted to use the above Welcome Message function dozens of times throughout your game, with several different characters with different names, you don’t want to have to write the logic every single time, for each character, every time it is used. It
      <br>
      <br>
would be easier to just write it once and be able to use it over and over again.
<br>
        <br>
Another advantage of functions is editability, meaning it is much easier to make changes. For example, let’s say you later decide you want the wording of the welcome message to be slightly different. If you had the logic in dozens of places, without using a function, you would have to manually try and find each of those places and then edit each one individually. But with a function, you only need to make the change in one place - in the function itself.
