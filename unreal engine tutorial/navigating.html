       Navigation In Viewport
      </h1>
      <br>
      
      <p  class="pintro" >

        There are three main ways to navigate in the Viewport.
        <br>
        <br>
         <b class="subheading"> Mouse Navigation</b>
         <br>
        <br>

        The first way to navigate the Viewport is by mouse navigation. Try holding down the left mouse button (LMB) and dragging the mouse. This allows you to move the camera forward or backwards and to rotate it left and right. There is no way to move up and down with this movement. It is only for travelling along the X and Y axes. Also, you cannot move directly left or right with this movement, you can only rotate left and right.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now hold the LMB and the right mouse button (RMB) at the same time and drag the mouse. This will allow you to move directly left and right and up and down. Also, if you have a middle mouse button, you can hold that down instead of the left and right mouse buttons, to achieve the same effect.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, try holding down just the RMB and dragging the mouse. This won’t move the camera along any axes but what it does do is allow you to rotate the camera in any direction so you can look at the scene from whatever angle you wish.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b class="subheading"> WASD Navigation</b>
        <br>
        <br>
The second way to navigate the Viewport is to use WASD navigation. This is used to move around the Viewport in a way that more closely mimics the controls commonly used when playing a standard first-person game using the mouse and keyboard. It’s called WASD because it uses the W, A, S and D keys on the keyboard, and a few of the keys surrounding those keys.
<br>
        <br>
To use WASD navigation, you will need to keep the RMB clicked the whole time. This will allow you to rotate the camera in any direction using the mouse, as discussed before, but also, when the RMB is clicked, the WASD keys will cause movement. Use the W, A, S and D keys themselves to move the camera forward, backwards, left, and right. Use the keys Q and E to move the camera up and down. Use the keys Z and C to zoom the camera in and out. Note that zooming is only temporary. Once you let go of the RMB, the zoom will go back to default.
<br>
        <br>
      <b class="subheading"> Focusing</b>
      <br>
      <br>
Before learning the third way of navigating the Viewport, you should know about focusing - a very simple yet powerful feature of the Viewport window. Focusing is useful in conjunction with the third navigation method and on its own.
<br>
        <br>
        
        To focus, press the F key, and it will focus the camera on whatever object is selected. This is useful in large Levels and Levels with many Actors. In these cases, it is often much easier to find the Actor in the World Outliner list and then press F to go straight to it in the Viewport, rather than trying to hunt for the Actor visually in the Viewport.
        <br>
        <br>
       <b class="subheading"> Maya Navigation</b>

The third way to navigate the Viewport is to use Maya navigation. Maya refers to a popular 3D modeling program in which these controls are used. The three controls in Maya navigation are performed by holding down the Alt key.
<br>
        <br>
The first Maya control is done by holding the Alt key, along with the LMB, and dragging the mouse. This will “tumble” or “orbit” the camera around a single point of interest. However, even if an Actor is selected, it won’t actually use that Actor as the point of interest. To do that, you must press F to focus on the Actor.
<br>
        <br>
The second Maya control is performed by holding the Alt key and the RMB and dragging the mouse. This will “dolly” or “zoom” the camera toward, and away from, a single point of interest. Again, press F to focus on an object first, in order to dolly directly towards and away from it.
<br>
        <br>
        The final Maya control is performed by holding down the Alt key and the MMB and dragging the mouse. This will cause the camera to “track”, or “pan”, up, down, left, and right.
        <br>
        <br>
       <b class="subheading"> Camera Speed</b>
       <br>
        <br>
        To adjust the speed at which the camera moves about the Level, adjust the camera speed slider in the upper-right corner of the Viewport. If you have a very large Level and want to be able to move about it quickly, you can set the camera speed up to an 8 and your camera will move very quickly. Conversely, if you need a fine level of control over the camera speed, you can set it down as low as a 1, and it will move very slowly. A setting of 4 is the default speed.
