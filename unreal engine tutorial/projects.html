        In the context of the Unreal Engine, a project is the unit that stores all the information for an individual game. Meaning each game you create will be stored in its own project.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, for a first-person shooter game, you might have a project called “ShooterProject.” If you wanted to work on another game, a puzzle game, you would create a new project and perhaps call it “PuzzleProject.” So if you are working on five different games, you should have five different projects, one for each game.
        <br>

       <b class="subheading"> Unreal Project Browser</b>
       <br>
        <br>
        To launch the Unreal Project Browser:
        <br>
        <br>
1. Go to your desktop and double-click on the Epic Games Launcher shortcut that you created during installation.
<br>
        <br>
2. Click the yellow “Launch” button in the upper-left corner.
<br>
        <br>
        The Unreal Project Browser is where you can open your existing projects or create new ones. It is divided into two tabs.
        <br>
        <br>
       <b class="subheading" > Projects Tab</b>
       <br>
        <br>
        The first tab is simply called Projects and will be selected by default whenever the Project Browser first opens. This tab is for existing projects. It contains thumbnail images of all existing projects that the Project Browser was able to find, which would include any projects within the installation directory, and any projects you previously created or opened using this installation of Unreal.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        If you click the Marketplace button, this will take you to the Marketplace tab of the Epic Games Launcher where you can download existing environments, objects, characters, etc. either for free or for a price.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the bottom-left corner is a checkbox labeled “Always load last project on startup.” If you check this, the next time you hit the Launch button in the Games Launcher, it will skip the Project Browser altogether and automatically open the last project you worked on. This is useful if you plan to be working on only one project for several days, weeks, or months at a time. It will allow you to skip this step every time.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you do this and then want to open a new or different project, you can still do that through the File menu of the Unreal Editor. If you later decide you do want the Project Browser to open on launch, you can change this setting in the Editor Preferences.
        <br>
        <br>
      <b class="subheading">  New Project Tab</b>
        <br>
        <br>
The second tab is the New Project tab. This tab has two tabs itself – a Blueprint tab and a C++ tab. On the Blueprint tab, there are twelve options to choose from – a blank project, and eleven template projects.
<br>
        <br>
        <img class="img" src="https://mammothinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1.png" width="700px" height="600px" style="border-radius: 20px; margin-left: 100px;  box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px black;" />
        <br>
        <br>
        The templates are all based around common game types. For example, the First Person template will load with several features common to first-person games already hooked up and ready to go. For a racing game, the Vehicle template would make a good choice. If you don’t choose these features here, you still have the option to add them in later if you want. You could choose a blank project to start with and then add in “First Person” features later, within the Editor.
