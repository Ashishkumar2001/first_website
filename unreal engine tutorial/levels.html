        A Level, in the context of the Unreal Engine, can be defined as a collection of objects and their properties that together define an area of gameplay.
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s the technical definition, but an easy way to visualize this is, if you’ve ever played a fighting game such as Super Smash Bros, or SoulCalibur, or Mortal Kombat, you know that each match takes place in a different location. The first match might take place in a palace and the next one in a forest, and so on. Each of these different locations would be its own Level within the Unreal Editor.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, think of FPS games such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. When you’re playing multiplayer, you might get asked to choose a map for the match to take place in. Each of those maps are their own Level.
Levels are loaded and unloaded into memory one-at-a-time. So if you’re playing a game where you’re in a town, and you can walk around the town and every time you enter or exit one of the buildings in the town, the game has to load; then that means that the outside of the town is a single Level, and each building interior is its own Level
<br>
<br>
A single game may consist of only one Level, but often will consist of many Levels. Major releases often contain hundreds of Levels.

          You have the option of choosing between “Default” and “Empty Level.” “Default” will start you off with some basic stuff already added, including a platform, an atmosphere, some lighting, etc. The “Empty Level” option will start you off with a completely empty Level.
