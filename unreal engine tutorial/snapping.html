         Snapping

        Snapping is a technique used to perfectly align Actors with one another. There are several different ways of using snapping.
        <br>
        <br>
       <b class="subheading"> End Key</b>
       <br>
        <br>
        The first method involves using the End key. When the End key is pressed while an Actor is selected, it will snap that Actor directly onto the nearest surface. This is useful for quickly aligning objects, such as getting Actors to sit directly on a floor.
        <br>
        <br>
       <b class="subheading"> Surface Snapping</b>
       <br>
       <br>
        Another way of using snapping is called Surface Snapping. Clicking on the icon to the right of the world space icon will bring up a small pop-up where you can turn on Surface Snapping. With Surface Snapping on, when the Move Tool is used to move an Actor around in three dimensions, any time it gets close to the surface of another Actor, it will snap the selected Actor to the surface of the nearby Actor.

       <br>
       Note that this only works when moving the object in three dimensions. It doesn’t work when moving Actors around in just one or two dimensions at a time. In other words, you need to be dragging the Actor around by the white sphere in the middle for Surface Snapping to work.
       <br>
       <br>
       Surface snapping has a couple of settings you can adjust to change how it behaves. The first setting is called Rotate to Surface Normal and it is set to “On” by default. The following example will illustrate how this works.
       <br>
       <br>
      <b class="subheading"> Grid Snapping</b>
      <br>
       <br>
You can also align objects by using Grid Snapping. While Surface Snapping is useful for aligning objects that are close to one another, Grid Snapping is useful for aligning objects across distances.
<br>
       <br>

Clicking the icon to the right of the Surface Snapping icon will toggle Grid Snapping on and off. With Grid Snapping on, as an Actor is moved, it will only be able to move it in the increments that the grid is divided into. The Actor will “snap” to each line of the grid and can’t move a smaller amount than that. With Grid Snapping off, an Actor can be moved any distance.
